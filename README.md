# Collection of Academic Latex Templates


This repository is a collection of latex templates I have used for a variety of use cases during my studies of computer science at ETHZ. 

It contains the following:

- [Exam Summary / Cheatsheet](./exam-summary/)
- [Homework Template](./homework/)
- [Lecture Notes Template](./lecture-notes/)
- [Graded Homework Template](./graded-homework/)


Feel free to fork it and submit your enhancements.
